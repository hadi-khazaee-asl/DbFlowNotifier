# DbFlowNotifier
a Simple Observable implementation for accessing DataBase changes when using DBFlow

i know DBFlow has Observablity functionalities but i do many research for a well document which describe how to implement it and use it ... and also the DbFlow GitBook's doesn't Update with new source codes documentation.

so i decide to create a simple #Notifier based on #java.util.Observable which works based on DbFlow.
